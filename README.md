# SQL-Server-Auditing
Audits all login activity and any attempts to alter or stop the auditing.
Requires correct configuration to work properely so you need to follow the installation instructions contained in the AuditDocumentation file which documents all the objects, has instructions on how to install and test.
If the audit fails for any reason an alert will be triggered which will send an email.
I recommend testing it to make sure it is working properly.
